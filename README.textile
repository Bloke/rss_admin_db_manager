h1. Textpattern Database Manager

The rss_admin_db_manager plugin adds three menu items to your Textpattern admin interface. Each contains different functionality to help manage your "MySQL":http://www.mysql.com/ database. You can think of this plugin as a lightweight replacement for "phpMyAdmin":http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/.

h2(#database-backup). Database Backup

The *DB Backup panel* allows you to backup, download and restore the MySQL database that is used for your Textpattern installation.

The database backups and restores are run using MySQL's "mysqldump":http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/mysqldump.html command.

On this panel you are able to:

* Create a .sql backup file on windows with the additional option of creating a gzipped backup on *nix operating systems
* View a list of previous backup files
* Restore your database from one of the previous backups
* Download a backup file
* Delete old backups

h2(#backup-preferences). Backup Preferences

You have the ability to set several preferences related to your database backups. You can set these options on the backup panel. The options include:

* *Lock Tables* - Your host may or may not support this option.For example, by default, Textdrive doesn't allow table locking.If your backup fails, try setting this to “No”.
* *Debug Mode* - Turning debugging on will echo the command being run to the screen.
* *Backup Path* - Set the directory that your backups will be saved to.
* *Mysqldump Path* - It's likely that the default will work for you.If not, enter the full path the the executable.
* *Mysql Path* - It's likely that the default will work for you.If not, enter the full path the the executable.

h2(#database-manager). Database Manager

The *DB Manager panel* displays information about your MySQL database and all of its tables. A detailed list includes the name of the table, number of rows and file space usage.

You will also be alerted of any overhead or errors that need to be repaired.Tables can be repaired, dropped or backed up from this listing.

* Clicking on the name of the table will run a @select * FROM [table name]@ SQL statement and take you to the *Run SQL panel* to display the results.
* Repair a single table in the listing by clicking the Repair link.
* Repair all tables in the listing by clicking the Repair All link.
* Backup a single table in the listing by clicking the Backup link.
* Drop a single table in the listing by clicking the Drop link.

h2(#run-sql-window). Run SQL Window

The *Run SQL tab* allows for free form entry and execution of SQL statements. The SQL window accepts

SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, CREATE, REPLACE, TRUNCATE, and DELETE statements. If a SELECT statement is run, the results will be displayed below the SQL window in a table.

The table markup allows you to add your own styles for creating a "CSS Scrollable Table":http://www.agavegroup.com/?p=31.
